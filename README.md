# Music-player

This is a web application for a Music player, which has all the features that a modern music player in production needs.  
Some of the features of the music player include -
+ Details of the current song (image, singer, song name) are displayed
+ Play/pause toggle button
+ Next and previous buttons
+ Shuffle button to randomize the song list
+ Menu button to access the songs list and can play the song from the menu by clicking on the desired song in the menu.
+ Progress bar thorugh which we can go to the specific time from where we want to listen to the song just by a click on it.
+ Time progress at the end of the progress bar which is synced with the progress of the song.


### Tech stack
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Vanilla javascript
+ jQuery

I am looking forward to make some updates in the app.  

Be free to give suggestions by opening a *Feature request* issue in the repository.
